linux static binary
1. download file 
2. verify what type file its
3. apply command file <file name>
4. later let's start with commnand ld then the file has dependecy library.
5. each command was writer in file type .txt
6. I tried apply command ltrace for I can view the file executable has path 
of library but it's no dynamicall.
7. apply command hexdump -C <file name> | head.
8. so string <file name> and wrote file type .txt
9. the .txt before apply cat <filename> | grep "ETSCTF"
10. I know that file is a ELF (Executable and  Linkable File), apply command readelf 
-h <filename> 
11. command objdum -d <filename> 
12. command readelf -h
13. command readelf -S (section ELF)
14. command readelf -l (segment ELF)  
15. typing command objdump -x <filename> wrote in the file.txt with all headers
16. apply objdump -M intel -d <filename> > objdump_elf_intel.txt
17. apply objdump -sj <for example .rodata .text etc>  <filename>
18. gdb -batch -ex 'file <file name>' -ex 'disassemble .rodata'
17. give it chmod +x <ELF file name> and apply gdb -q
18. typing break main
19. apply info register or i r 
20. apply i r eax and nexti.
21. I want to find flag1; I was trying with gdb and other way was:
22. I getting data_intel with command line objdump -M intel -Sj .data > 
data_intel.txt
23. in the function getting with objdump -M intel -Sj .text > text.txt
24. Analyzing text.txt its function main and x375fc0ff33 in display
print value uintMAX and x375fb33ff I saw m1 and m2
