1. Assessment overviews: How we perform the assessment 
so planing discovery attack and reporting  now this based on 
next guidelines -phases of a attack and just detail that for
the client so that they can understand what they're 
getting and what our methodology was.
-external e internal penetration test

2. Finding Severity Ratings: we define a critical versus
something like an information so we say hey the cvss score
might be a nine on critical and the exploitations are very 
straightforward where informational is justo no vulnerability 
exists

Bug bounties are really focus on critical and high where a pen
tes look at everything 

3. Risk factors: Likelihood so how likely is this attack 
to occur and impact just like bug bounty we want to know what
the impact if this were to be exploited 

4. Scope: we have external and internal and then web application
domain that we tested and then what exclusion we have so we 
were not allowed to do any denial service

5. Executive Summary: for non-technical people I'm not going
to sit here read it to you but what I'm going to cover is just
why we're writing it this way 

6. Security strengths: SIEM alerts of vulnerability scans
Multi factors Authentication and strong password policy.

7. Security Weaknesses: how session fixation, potential denial
of service.

8. Vulnerability Summary & Report Card.

9. Technical Findings
