Findings

For the purposes of this course, you should include the following
for each vulnerability:
-Title --E.g. "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in profiles"
-severity
-Description --Brief description of what the vulnerability is
-Reproduction Steps --Brief description of how to reproduce
the bug; preferably with a small proof of concept.
-Impact -- What  can be done with the vulnerability?
-Mitigation --How is it fixed?
-Affected assets --Generally a list of affected URLs.

**Severity**
This is handled differently just about everywhere, but I recommed  basing 
severity on difficulty of exploitation and potential business
impact. The following rankings are what I use:

-Informational --Issues  has no real impact.
-Low --The business impact is minimal.
-Medium --Potencial to cause harm to users, but not revealing data
-High --Potencial to reveal user data or aids in exploitation of other
vulnerabilies
-Critical --High risk of personal/confidenctial data exposure, general 
system compromise, and other severe impacts to the business.
